# Registration-form-using-html-css-and-bootstrap
In this Project I made a registration form using **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap** and **implement **VALIDATIONS** using Javascript**.
This project is about a registraion web page which is responsive in nature which means it can change according to device width.

##Content present in this registration form
There are basically three section presnt in the form: 

> Basic Components
1. First Name
2. Last Name
3. Email
4. Password
5. Mobile Number: - ***User can't enter text or more than 10 numbers.***


> Account type and Terms and conditions.

In this section User may chose either his/her account as ***personal or business*** account and user must have to tick the checkbox created for terms and conditions.


> Documentation and How you hear about us section.
1. Profile picture: in this section user can ***upload*** his/her profile picture
2. Age: in this area user can enter his/her age. minimum age=13 and maximum age=120. ***User can't enter more than 4 number***.
3. How you hear about us section: In this a dropdown or referrer opens from which an user can choose an option to select from.
